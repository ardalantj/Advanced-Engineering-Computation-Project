WINDOWS
	NOTE: IT CAN'T BE BUILT WITH JUST THESE FILES, ONLY IN MY VS ENVIRONMENT
	Adding the glut library should work for build, but it's a major pain	
	Just build in visual studio if it can be figured out
	Executable needs to be tied to freeglut.dll if it will be ran on a machine without glut installed






LINUX (Ubuntu)

	Installing glut/gl/everything and checking if it is okay

		sudo add-apt-repository universe
		sudo apt update
		sudo apt install g++
		sudo apt-get install freeglut3-dev
		sudo apt-cache search glut
		dpkg -L freeglut3-dev
	
	Building and run

		g++ *.cpp *.h -o AECPROJECT -lGL -lglut -lGLU
		./AECPROJECT

MACOS

	Probably very similar to LINUX
